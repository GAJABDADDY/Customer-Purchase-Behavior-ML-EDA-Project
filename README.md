# Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis ML EDA Project

## Overview
This project is an implementation of customer purchase behavior analysis using machine learning techniques in Python. It aims to understand and predict customer behavior patterns based on historical purchase data.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing and visualizing patterns and trends in the data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementing various ML algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and neural networks for analysis.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Prediction:** Using trained models to predict customer behavior for new data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy, pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
- Jupyter Notebook for development and analysis
